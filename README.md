# aSymmetry

Our first Java project during the bootcamp (3 weeks of Java).
To compile the .jar file use the build.xml (our ANT file) and run the jarfile option.

These are the concepts we knew when we started this project:

Basic OOP principles,
Methods, Constructors, Encapsulation, Enumerations,
Composition, Delegation, Inheritance, Method Overriding and Overloading,
Abstract Classes, Polymorphism, Interfaces, Containers.
